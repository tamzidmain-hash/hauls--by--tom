Act as a senior full-stack web developer, UI/UX designer, and brand strategist.

I want to create a modern, professional website from scratch.

Your task:
1. Ask me ONLY the minimum necessary questions first (brand name, purpose, style).
2. Then generate a COMPLETE, ready-to-use website including:
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - script.js (only if needed)
3. The website must be:
   - Responsive (mobile + desktop)
   - Clean and modern
   - Beginner-friendly
   - No external frameworks unless absolutely necessary
4. Use clear comments in the code so I understand it.
5. Tell me EXACTLY:
   - Where to save each file
   - How to open the website on my computer
   - How to edit text and images later
6. If this website is suitable for selling products, explain what is missing (payments, backend) and how to add it later.

Important:
- Assume I am a beginner
- Do everything step by step
- Do NOT skip steps
- Do NOT overcomplicate
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. I will keep this very simple and beginner friendly.

Before I build anything, I need only these 3 things from you. Nothing more.

1) Brand name
What is the exact name of the website or brand?

2) Purpose
What is the main goal of this website?
Choose one or answer in your own words:

Personal brand or portfolio

Business or company website

Clothing or product showcase

Informational website

Other

3) Style preference
How should it feel visually?
You can pick one or two:

Minimal and clean

Luxury / premium

Modern tech

Dark theme

Light theme

Old money / classic

Bold and colorful

Reply with just these three answers.
Once you reply, I will build the entire website from scratch and guide you step by step without skipping anything.

You said:
brand name Hauls by tom purpose is personal brand style preference old money and classic
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. I will now build a complete, ready to use website for your brand.

Brand: Hauls by Tom
Purpose: Personal brand
Style: Old money, classic, luxury

I will keep everything simple, clean, and beginner friendly.

STEP 1: Folder structure
First, create a main folder anywhere on your computer.

Name the folder exactly:

hauls-by-tom
Inside this folder, create three files:

hauls-by-tom
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
STEP 2: index.html
Create a file named index.html and paste everything below into it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Basic setup -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

STEP 3: style.css
Create a file named style.css and paste everything below.

/* Basic reset */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;

STEP 4: script.js
This website does not need JavaScript yet.

Create script.js and add this minimal comment so the file exists.

// JavaScript is not needed right now.
// This file is ready for future features.
STEP 5: How to open the website
Open the hauls-by-tom folder

Double click index.html

The website opens in your browser

No internet needed.

STEP 6: How to edit text later
Open index.html in:

Notepad

VS Code

Any text editor

Change the words between the tags.

Example:

<h2>Timeless Style. Quiet Luxury.</h2>
Just edit the text and save.

STEP 7: How to add images later
Create a folder called:

images
Put images inside it

Add images like this inside HTML:

<img src="images/coat.jpg" alt="Classic coat">
STEP 8: Can this sell products?
Yes, visually it is suitable.
What is missing:

No product pages

No cart system

No payment system

No backend or database

How to add later
Payments: Stripe or PayPal

Backend: Node.js or Python

Database: Firebase or MySQL

Or easiest: Shopify integration

When you are ready, I can upgrade this into a full ecommerce website step by step.

If you want next:

Product page

Lookbook layout

Instagram style gallery

Shopify ready version

Hosting and domain guide

Just tell me what to build next.

You said:
i cant copy paste my code in folder option not showing
ChatGPT said:
No problem. This is very common for beginners. We will fix it slowly and safely.

I will assume you are on Windows. If not, tell me.

FIRST: Why you do NOT see a “paste code in folder” option
You never paste code directly into a folder.

Folders only contain files.
You paste code inside a file, not the folder.

So the steps are always:

Create the file

Open the file

Paste code inside

Save

STEP 1: Enable file extensions (very important)
Most beginners accidentally create files like index.html.txt.

Do this first
Open File Explorer

Click View at the top

Click Show

Tick File name extensions

Now you can see .html, .css, .js

STEP 2: Create the folder correctly
Right click on Desktop

Click New → Folder

Name it:

hauls-by-tom
STEP 3: Create index.html correctly
Open the hauls-by-tom folder

Right click inside the empty space

Click New → Text Document

Rename it to:

index.html
Windows may warn you. Click Yes.

STEP 4: Open index.html to paste code
Option A: Using Notepad (easiest)
Right click index.html

Click Open with → Notepad

Now you will see a white page

Paste the HTML code I gave you

Press Ctrl + S to save

Close Notepad

You are done with index.html.

STEP 5: Create style.css
Inside hauls-by-tom folder

Right click → New → Text Document

Rename it to:

style.css
Right click → Open with → Notepad

Paste the CSS code

Press Ctrl + S

Close

STEP 6: Create script.js
Right click → New → Text Document

Rename it to:

script.js
Open with Notepad

Paste the JavaScript comment

Save and close

STEP 7: Open the website
Double click index.html

Your website opens in the browser

If it opens as text instead of a website, tell me immediately.

COMMON MISTAKES (check this)
❌ index.html.txt
❌ Code pasted into folder
❌ CSS not loading because file names mismatch
❌ Files not in same folder

All three files must be side by side:

hauls-by-tom
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
If you are still stuck
Reply with one sentence only:

What exactly happens when you double click index.html

Or send a screenshot description like:
“It opens in Notepad”
“It shows code”
“Blank page”

I will fix it for you instantly.

You said:
my laptop is asus rog strix
ChatGPT said:
Good. ASUS ROG Strix is just the laptop brand.
What matters is the operating system, and almost all ROG Strix laptops run Windows.

So the instructions I gave already apply to you.

Now I will reconfirm everything cleanly, step by step, with no assumptions skipped.

CONFIRM YOUR OS IN 10 SECONDS
Look at the bottom left of your screen.

If you see a Start button (Windows logo) → you are on Windows
This is 99 percent likely.

We continue with Windows steps.

WHY YOU ARE STUCK RIGHT NOW
You are trying to paste code into a folder.
Folders do not accept code.
Only files accept code.

So we fix this properly.

DO THIS EXACTLY. NO CHANGES.
STEP 1: Turn on file extensions
This prevents mistakes.

Open File Explorer

Click View on top

Click Show

Turn on File name extensions

You must see .txt, .html, etc.

STEP 2: Create the main folder
Right click on Desktop

Click New → Folder

Name it exactly:

hauls-by-tom
STEP 3: Create index.html
Open hauls-by-tom

Right click inside empty space

Click New → Text Document

Rename it to:

index.html
Click Yes when Windows warns you

Important: it must say index.html, not index.html.txt

STEP 4: Paste code correctly
Right click index.html

Click Open with → Notepad

Paste the HTML code I gave you

Press Ctrl + S

Close Notepad

You have now pasted code correctly.

STEP 5: Create style.css
Repeat the same process:

Right click → New → Text Document

Rename to:

style.css
Open with Notepad

Paste CSS code

Save and close

STEP 6: Create script.js
Again:

Right click → New → Text Document

Rename to:

script.js
Open with Notepad

Paste JavaScript comment

Save and close

FINAL CHECK
Your folder must look like this:

hauls-by-tom
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
All three files at the same level.

OPEN THE WEBSITE
Double click index.html

It should open in Chrome or Edge

You should see a black luxury website saying Hauls by Tom

IF IT DOES NOT WORK
Reply with only one of these sentences:

“It opens in Notepad”

“It shows code”

“Blank page”

“CSS not working”

Do not explain. Just one sentence.

I will fix it immediately and move you forward.

You said:
its does not work
ChatGPT said:
Good. We will fix this now. Follow this exactly. Do not skip anything.

MOST LIKELY PROBLEM
Your file is still a text file, not a real .html file.

Windows often hides this mistake.

FIX IT PROPERLY (2 minutes)
STEP 1: Check the real file name
Open the hauls-by-tom folder

Look carefully at the file name

If you see any of these, it is wrong:

index.html.txt

index (1).html

index.html but the icon looks like Notepad

STEP 2: Rename correctly
Right click the file

Click Rename

Rename it to exactly:

index.html
Press Enter

If Windows asks for confirmation, click Yes

Important:
There must be no .txt at the end.

STEP 3: Force browser opening
Even if Windows is confused, this works.

Right click index.html

Click Open with

Click Choose another app

Select Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge

Tick Always use this app

Click OK

QUICK TEST (VERY IMPORTANT)
Open index.html again.

Tell me exactly one thing you see:

Reply with one line only, choose one:

“I see the Hauls by Tom website”

“I see plain text code”

“I see a blank white page”

“Browser opens but no design”

Do not explain. Just one line.

I will take the next step immediately based on your answer.

You said:
when i click choose another app there is not option of chrome or edge only showing noteptad or microsoft store showing app related notepad
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. This tells me exactly what is wrong.
Your Windows does not know that Chrome or Edge can open HTML files, but the browsers are still there.

We will bypass the “Choose another app” screen completely.

Follow this slowly, exactly.

METHOD 1 (THIS ALWAYS WORKS)
STEP 1: Open your browser first
Open Google Chrome
or Microsoft Edge
Open it normally like you browse the internet.

STEP 2: Drag the file into the browser
Open File Explorer

Open your hauls-by-tom folder

Click and hold index.html

Drag it into the open browser window

Release the mouse

✅ The website will open.

This works even if Windows is confused.

IF IT OPENS BUT LOOKS PLAIN (IMPORTANT)
If you see text but no black design:

CHECK THESE 3 THINGS
style.css is in the same folder

File name is exactly:

style.css
In index.html you have this line:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
No extra spaces. No capital letters.

METHOD 2 (FORCE EDGE DIRECTLY)
If drag does not work, do this:

Right click index.html

Click Open

NOT “Open with”

Edge usually opens it directly

LAST RESORT TEST (VERY IMPORTANT)
We will test if HTML works at all.

DO THIS:
Open index.html with Notepad

Delete everything

Paste this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>TEST PAGE</h1>
<p>If you see this, HTML works.</p>
</body>
</html>
Press Ctrl + S

Drag the file into Chrome or Edge again

NOW REPLY WITH ONE LINE ONLY
Choose one:

“I see TEST PAGE”

“Browser opens but blank”

“Nothing opens”

“It still opens in Notepad”

Do not explain.
Once you answer, I will fix the final blocker and get your site live.

You said:
it showing only the text
ChatGPT said:
Good. This confirms the issue 100 percent.
Your file is still being treated as plain text, not real HTML.

We will fix this permanently.

THE ROOT CAUSE
Your file is named:

index.html.txt
but Windows is hiding .txt.

So the browser shows text instead of a webpage.

FIX IT ONCE AND FOR ALL (DO THIS EXACTLY)
STEP 1: Show real extensions again
Even if you did it before, repeat.

Open File Explorer

Click View

Click Show

Make sure File name extensions is ON

STEP 2: Rename properly
In the hauls-by-tom folder

Right click the file

Click Rename

Rename it to exactly:

index.html
NOT index.html.txt

Press Enter

Click Yes if Windows warns you

STEP 3: Confirm the icon
After renaming:

The icon should change

It should no longer look like a Notepad file

STEP 4: Open it
Double click index.html
OR

Drag into Chrome or Edge

Now it will render as a website.

FINAL TEST
After fixing, you should see:

Black background

“Hauls by Tom” logo

Navigation menu

Big headline text

IF IT STILL SHOWS TEXT
Reply with only one line:

“File name shows index.html.txt”

“File name shows index.html”

“Icon did not change”

Do not explain.
This is the final step.

You said:
st showing my  brand name and etc information not showing logo or desing something just text
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. This is actually good news.
It means HTML is working, but CSS is NOT loading. We fix only CSS now.

Stay calm. This is a very common beginner issue.

WHAT IS HAPPENING
Your browser is reading index.html
But it cannot find style.css

So it shows:

Text only

No black background

No layout

No design

FIX IN 3 SIMPLE CHECKS
CHECK 1: File names must be EXACT
Open the hauls-by-tom folder and confirm you see:

index.html
style.css
script.js
Things that are WRONG:

style.css.txt

Style.css

style.CSS

It must be exactly:

style.css
Lowercase. No extra text.

CHECK 2: Files must be in the SAME folder
Open hauls-by-tom.

Do NOT put style.css inside another folder.
Do NOT put it in Documents or Downloads.

All three files must sit together like this:

hauls-by-tom
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
CHECK 3: CSS link inside index.html
Open index.html with Notepad.

Find this line inside <head>:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
Make sure:

It is inside <head>

Spelling is exact

No extra spaces

No capital letters

Correct example:

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hauls by Tom</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
Save the file. Close Notepad.

FORCE REFRESH (IMPORTANT)
Browsers sometimes cache old files.

Do this:

Open the website

Press Ctrl + F5

Now check again.

QUICK CSS TEST (VERY IMPORTANT)
We will test if CSS is loading at all.

Open style.css

At the VERY TOP paste this:

body {
    background-color: red !important;
}
Press Ctrl + S

Refresh the website

RESULT
If background turns red, CSS is working

If nothing changes, CSS is not linked

NOW REPLY WITH ONE LINE ONLY
Choose one:

“Background turned red”

“Still black text only”

“style.css file shows .txt”

Do not explain.
Once you reply, I will finish the fix completely and your design will appear.

You said:
now i can see my website in black also with brand name
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. That means everything is working correctly now. Well done.

Now we will clean up, explain what you’re seeing, and show you how to edit safely.

STEP 1: REMOVE THE TEST RED BACKGROUND
You added this earlier to test CSS:

body {
    background-color: red !important;
}
Do this now
Open style.css

Delete that red background code

Save the file

Refresh the browser

Your website will return to the black old-money style.

STEP 2: WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON SCREEN
You now have:

Black luxury background

Brand name Hauls by Tom at the top

Navigation links

Hero headline

Clean classic layout

This is a real working website, not a mockup.

STEP 3: HOW TO CHANGE TEXT SAFELY
Example: Change the main headline
Open index.html
Find this:

<h2>Timeless Style. Quiet Luxury.</h2>
Change it to anything you want:

<h2>Classic Menswear. Timeless Elegance.</h2>
Save. Refresh browser.

STEP 4: HOW TO CHANGE COLORS
Open style.css

Background color
body {
    background-color: #0b0b0b;
}
Darker → #000000
Softer → #111111

Accent color (gold tone)
nav a:hover {
    color: #c0a060;
}
Change gold shade if you want.

STEP 5: ADDING A LOGO LATER
Create a folder:

images
Put your logo inside. Example:

logo.png
Replace this in index.html:

<h1 class="logo">Hauls by Tom</h1>
With:

<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Hauls by Tom logo" class="logo-image">
Then add this to style.css:

.logo-image {
    height: 40px;
}
STEP 6: IS THIS READY FOR SELLING CLOTHES?
YES visually
NO technically
Missing:

Product pages

Cart system

Payment gateway

Order management

Security

Easiest upgrade path
Shopify integration

Stripe payments

Or custom backend later

This website is a perfect foundation.

WHAT WE CAN BUILD NEXT
Choose one:

Product page layout

Lookbook / gallery

Instagram-style feed

Shopify ready version

Hosting + domain guide

Just tell me the next step and we continue cleanly.

You said:
i  dont see any red background code
ChatGPT said:
That is completely fine. Nothing is broken.

Here is what happened in simple terms.

You did not add the red background test code, or it was already removed.
That means your CSS is loading correctly and your website is already in its final proper state.

So there is nothing to fix regarding the red background.

WHY YOU ARE SEEING BLACK AND DESIGN NOW
This confirms all of these are correct:

index.html is real HTML

style.css is linked correctly

Files are named correctly

Files are in the same folder

Browser is rendering CSS

You are officially past the hardest beginner problem.

WHAT TO DO NEXT (IMPORTANT)
From now on, only edit these two files:

index.html for text and structure

style.css for colors, layout, fonts

You do not need to touch script.js yet.

QUICK CONFIDENCE CHECK
Open style.css and look at the top.
You should see something like this:

body {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
    background-color: #0b0b0b;
    color: #eaeaea;
}
This is your black luxury look. This is correct.

NEXT SAFE EDIT TO TRY (OPTIONAL)
Try changing the hero text to confirm you are comfortable.

In index.html, find:

<h2>Timeless Style. Quiet Luxury.</h2>
Change it to:

<h2>Old Money Style. Classic Elegance.</h2>
Save and refresh.

If that works, you are fully in control.

YOU ARE NOW AT THIS LEVEL
You have a working professional website

You understand files vs folders

You fixed HTML and CSS linking

You can safely edit content

This is exactly where a junior web developer starts.

Tell me what you want next, one choice only:
Add a logo properly

Add clothing images

Make a product page

Make it Shopify ready

Learn hosting and domain

I will guide you step by step without overcomplicating.

You said:
i have a quest my text colour in style css is white there is not greeen or red touch as you are shwoing
ChatGPT said:
Good question. Nothing is wrong. This is exactly how the site is designed right now.

I will explain this very clearly, step by step, in beginner terms.

WHY ALL YOUR TEXT LOOKS WHITE
In your style.css, you have this rule:

body {
    color: #eaeaea;
}
This means:

ALL text is light white by default

Headings, paragraphs, menus inherit this color

This is intentional for an old money, classic look

So you will not see green or red by default.

WHERE THE GOLD ACCENT ACTUALLY IS
The gold color exists here:

nav a:hover {
    color: #c0a060;
}
Important:

This color shows ONLY when you hover

It appears when you move your mouse over the menu links

Test it now
Move your mouse over About, Collection, Contact

The text should turn gold

That is the accent. Subtle, classy, old money.

WHY YOU SAW RED EARLIER
Red was never part of the design.
Red was only mentioned as a temporary test to check if CSS loads.

You correctly did not see it because:

You never added it

Or it was already removed

So no red should exist now.

IF YOU WANT A PERMANENT GOLD TOUCH
Option 1: Make headings gold
In style.css, add this at the bottom:

h2, h3 {
    color: #c0a060;
}
Now section titles will be gold.

Option 2: Make logo gold
Find this in style.css:

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
}
Change it to:

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    color: #c0a060;
}
Now “Hauls by Tom” is gold.

Option 3: Subtle underline accent
Add this:

.section h2 {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #c0a060;
    display: inline-block;
    padding-bottom: 5px;
}
Very classic. Very old money.

IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLE YOU ARE FOLLOWING
Old money design means:

No bright colors everywhere

No loud contrasts

Accent colors appear sparingly

Mostly black, white, grey, gold

Your website already follows this correctly.

QUICK CHECK FOR YOU
Answer yes or no:

When you hover the menu links, do they turn gold?

Reply with just:

“Yes”
or

“No”

If yes, everything is perfect.
If no, I will fix it instantly.

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Excellent. That confirms everything is working exactly as intended.

You now have:

A real, functioning website

Correct HTML structure

Correct CSS loading

Subtle gold accent on hover

Clean old-money aesthetic

This is the correct baseline. Nothing is broken.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NEXT (SAFE PROGRESSION)
From here, you should only make small, controlled changes. I will show you the best next steps.

STEP 1: Make the brand feel more premium (recommended)
Make the logo permanently gold
In style.css, update this block:

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    color: #c0a060;
}
Save and refresh.

STEP 2: Improve typography slightly (optional but classy)
Add this at the bottom of style.css:

h2 {
    letter-spacing: 1px;
}
This adds a refined, luxury feel.

STEP 3: Add a hero background image later (optional)
If you want a classic fashion photo behind the hero:

Create folder:

images
Add an image like:

hero.jpg
Replace this in style.css:

.hero {
    background-color: #050505;
}
With:

.hero {
    background-image: url("images/hero.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}
STEP 4: Understand what you have built
You currently have:

A static website

No server needed

No database

No payments

This is perfect for:

Brand presence

Instagram bio link

Lookbook

Personal fashion brand

STEP 5: When you are ready to sell
To sell clothes, you will eventually need:

Product pages

Cart

Payments

Orders

Best beginner path:

Connect this design to Shopify

Or build slowly with Stripe later

I can guide both.

YOU ARE NOW READY FOR NEXT UPGRADE
Choose one and tell me:

Add product page

Add lookbook gallery

Add logo image

Make it mobile-first better

Hosting and domain setup

We will continue step by step, no rush, no confusion.

You said:
where to write those  changes
ChatGPT said:
Good question. I will be very precise so you do not get confused.

You have two main files you will edit:

index.html → for text and structure

style.css → for colors, design, layout

I will show exactly where to write each change.

1️⃣ WHERE TO MAKE THE LOGO GOLD
File to open
👉 style.css

What to do
Open style.css with Notepad

Find this code (already there):

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
}
Replace it with this:

.logo {
    font-size: 24px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    color: #c0a060;
}
Press Ctrl + S

Refresh the browser

✅ Your brand name turns gold.

2️⃣ WHERE TO ADD GOLD HEADINGS (OPTIONAL)
File to open
👉 style.css

Where to write it
Scroll to the VERY BOTTOM of the file
Add this on a new line:

h2, h3 {
    color: #c0a060;
}
Save → Refresh.

3️⃣ WHERE TO CHANGE TEXT (HEADLINE, PARAGRAPHS)
File to open
👉 index.html

Example: Change hero text
Find this line:

<h2>Timeless Style. Quiet Luxury.</h2>
Change it to anything you want, for example:

<h2>Old Money Style. Classic Elegance.</h2>
Save → Refresh.

4️⃣ WHERE TO ADD A HERO BACKGROUND IMAGE (OPTIONAL)
Step A: Create image folder
Inside hauls-by-tom, create a folder:

images
Put an image inside, for example:

hero.jpg
Step B: Edit CSS
Open style.css

Find this block:

.hero {
    height: 70vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #050505;
}
Replace only the background line with this:

.hero {
    height: 70vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    text-align: center;
    background-image: url("images/hero.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}
Save → Refresh.

5️⃣ GOLDEN RULE (IMPORTANT)
HTML → words, sections, content

CSS → color, font, spacing, design

If something looks wrong:

Check spelling

Check file name

Save

Refresh browser

QUICK CONFIRMATION
Reply with one word only:

logo → if logo color change worked

text → if text edit worked

image → if image worked

all → if everything worked

I will guide the next step based on your answer.

You said:
my logo colour is not changed
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. This is a very common CSS behavior, and it is easy to fix.
Nothing is broken.

Your logo color is not changing because another CSS rule is overriding it.

We will fix this in the safest beginner way.

WHY THE LOGO COLOR DID NOT CHANGE
Your logo text is:

<h1 class="logo">Hauls by Tom</h1>
But the text color is inherited from this rule:

body {
    color: #eaeaea;
}
Sometimes the browser keeps using this unless we explicitly override it.

FIX IT (100 percent guaranteed)
STEP 1: Open style.css
Right click → Open with → Notepad

STEP 2: GO TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE FILE
Scroll all the way down.

STEP 3: ADD THIS CODE AT THE BOTTOM
Do NOT replace anything.
Just add this as new lines:

.logo {
    color: #c0a060 !important;
}
The !important forces the color.
This is acceptable for beginners and small projects.

STEP 4: SAVE AND REFRESH
Press Ctrl + S

Go to browser

Press Ctrl + F5

Your logo will turn gold.

IF IT STILL DOES NOT CHANGE (VERY RARE)
Then your logo is being styled by a more specific rule.

In that case, add this instead at the bottom:

header .logo {
    color: #c0a060 !important;
}
Save → Refresh.

QUICK CONFIRMATION
Reply with one word only:

gold → logo turned gold

white → still white

I will respond instantly based on your answer.

You said:
there is no logo in my website my bad i did not saw it
ChatGPT said:
All good. Your site does have a “logo”, it is just text right now.

In your website, the “logo” is the brand name at the top left:
Hauls by Tom

That text is the logo area.

OPTION A: Keep it as a text logo (cleanest)
Make the brand name gold
Open style.css, scroll to the bottom, add:

header .logo {
    color: #c0a060;
}
Save (Ctrl + S), then refresh (Ctrl + F5).

OPTION B: Add a real image logo
Step 1: Create an images folder
Inside your hauls-by-tom folder create:

images
Step 2: Put your logo image there
Example file name:

images/logo.png
